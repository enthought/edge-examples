# This is the Dockerfile for the Enthought Edge "external" example.
# 
# We use "edm-rockylinux-8" as the base image.  This is a Rockylinux-8 based
# image which includes EDM.
#
# EDM dependencies for the app are brought in via a .zbundle file.  This avoids
# the need to pass your EDM token and/or a custom edm.yaml into the Dockerfile.
#
# We perform a two-stage build, to avoid including the .zbundle in the layers
# of the published image.

# First stage

ARG BASE_IMAGE=quay.io/enthought/edm-rockylinux-8:latest

ARG EDGE_BUNDLE=app_environment.zbundle

RUN adduser app
USER app
WORKDIR /home/app

# Create a default EDM environment using the enthought_edge bundle
RUN edm env import -f /tmp/app_environment.zbundle edm && edm cache purge --yes


# Second stage

FROM $BASE_IMAGE AS stage_two
